why is kitter in box

discord.py typing is so much cleaner
instead of start and stop typing funcs with js
it just stops typing automatically after everything in the `with` is done
that is hoot!
i can just wrap the process commands in typing
message.channel.send('run')
now watch this!
oh no it typing
lol broke
ok im probably gonna keep typing for expensive commands instead
thats funky
oh no what the fuck
shut the fuck down
it is fast
shut up letterbot
why are you so stupid
they are you can you please send me the address and i will send you a picture of the year
typing forever
are you not gonna include
customizable prefix
why aren't they present nicholas
it still `functions`
i must spawn a function to reload the markov
im making my code c l e a n e r
it literally worked fine
android app
lol and you called mine broken
yours just pastes xml
cause theres no good libraries for markov
markov strings worked fine for me
its your data
wherever youre getting this from
i had 4000 strings and it still generated shit
cause a lot of it was code already
and i removed it all
and its still shit
well obviously not!
im gonna smack you
i dont know!
i dont know!
why are you so fucking stupid
why are you unable to say anything else
it learns from you kieht.

i dont want to read it
discord.py is smarter than discord.js
you dont have to convert back and forth from member
member subclasses user
why des it sometimes
maybe related to the reason it sometimes reloads in -20 ms
the code for it just
subtracts the timestamps
reloadmessage.createdtimestamp - message.createdtimestamp
4 second connectipn ing
why is the gateway field even there
it looks cool
if its not `wss://gateway.discord.gg/` your bot wont be responding

cause of repeat
repeat being funky

i see minky
look at it
lol it takes d:: commands
prefixes are funky!
im trying to figure out how to get it to ignore that stuff
i had to add a special case in my bots regex for commands that start with d::
i use this
it catches code blocks
and anything that doesnt start with a letter or number
please dont tell me you pasted it with the r""
i can see when they started listening
i wont though cause utc lol
oh dear god
wifi dying
it splits it up
well thats funky!

i might add like
me write a sexy funk
a commands object
to the database
and then add a way
to toggle their usage
store the command
temporariltjerik
have an object

keyed by command name
you could just have an array in the guild db
and if the command is in the array
disable it
