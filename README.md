### Thanks
Thanks to [kaylynn234](https://github.com/kaylynn234) for a lot but commit [`b308f5d`](https://github.com/keli5/LettersBotPY/commit/b308f5d6e5cb8f60ce90a73788b06689c9610293) in particular  <br>
And huge thanks to [everyone who works on crimsoBOT](https://github.com/crimsobot/crimsoBOT/) because the help command may, or may not, be directly lifted from them

## Setup?
Install Python, preferably 3.9+, but it should hopefully work on 3.7 and up
Clone the bot or download the zip and extract it to a directory of your choice.
do `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory to automatically install required dependencies<br>
Run launcher.py to start the bot - on first run, it will create a sqlite3 file<br>
Should work on Python 3.7 and up, tested on 3.7.5-3.9.9<br>
Check out the config.template.json file. The keys are pretty self explanatory.<br>
Your config file should be called `config.json.` The .template.json is only just that, a template. <br>
Make sure that you change the classes/botowners.txt to contain user IDs of people who should be able to run owner-only commands.
