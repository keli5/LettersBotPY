### Thanks
Thanks to [kaylynn234](https://github.com/kaylynn234) for a lot but commit [`b308f5d`](https://github.com/keli5/LettersBotPY/commit/b308f5d6e5cb8f60ce90a73788b06689c9610293) in particular  <br>
Thanks to [Litleck](https://github.com/Litleck) for something

## Setup?
Run launcher.py to start the bot - on first run, it will create a sqlite3 file<br>
Should work on Python 3.6+<br>
You'll need an environment variable called BOT_TOKEN, containing the token of the discord bot you want to run this as<br>
Make sure that you change the classes/botowners.txt to contain user IDs of people who should be able to run owner-only commands and use Jishaku if installed
### Deps
- discord‏.‏py
- tortoise-orm
- pillow-simd
- optionally, jishaku for debugging
<br>do `pip install -r requirements.txt` to automatically install these dependencies<br>
if pillow-simd fails, manually install pillow as a replacement with `pip install pillow`
